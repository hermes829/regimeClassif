\section{Overview}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Goal}

Create country/year probabilistic measures of archetypical regime types, specifically:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Democracy
	\item Militaristic	
	\item Monarchical
	\item One-Party
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Method: Supervised Approaches}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Bernoulli Naive Bayes
	\item Support Vector Machines (SVM)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Data}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Textual Data}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Scraped all country level reports for 1999-2013 from: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item State Department Human Right Reports
			\item Freedom House Freedom in the World Reports
		\end{itemize}
	\item Cleaning textual data:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Removed numbers, punctuation, and stopwords
			\item Tokenized results
			\item Lemmatized tokens to group together inflected forms
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Datasets used for Labels}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Marshall et al. 2014 (Polity)
	\item Freedom House 2014 (FH)
	\item Geddes et al. 2014 (GWF)
	\item Hadenius et al. 2012 (ADR)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Label Rules}

\begin{block}{Democracy}
If Polity equals 10 and FH equals Free then we set Democracy for country-year equal to one otherwise zero
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Military, Monarchy, \& Party}
If GWF and ADR dataset agree on coding for country-year then variable equals one otherwise zero
\end{block}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Empirics}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Cross-Validation Strategy}

\begin{block}{Democracy}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Training dataset: 1,557 cases from 1999-2008 
	\item Test dataset: 707 cases from 2009-2013
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Military, Monarchy, \& Party}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Training dataset: 1,138 cases from 1999-2006 
	\item Test dataset: 583 cases from 2007-2010
	\item Shorter timeline because GWF and ADR datasets end at 2010
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Features for Supervised Models}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Vectorized tokens from combined State and FH reports for a given country-year
	\item Experimented with additional features but supervised models with just vectorized tokens performed the best (in terms of precision, recall and accuracy), see below for other features attempted:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Word count of combined tokens
		\item Posterior topic predictions from an unsupervised LDA
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
